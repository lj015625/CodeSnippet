"""Write a function that checks if a list of integers is normally distributed.
Specifically given a list of 100 numbers, write a function that returns a score that measures the deviation from normality. I.E. a normally distributed list of integers would return 0.
Note: Use What Is called the 68-95-99.7 rule of thumb for normal distributions.
Bonus: Donâ€™t use any graphical output or a statistical test for normality.
