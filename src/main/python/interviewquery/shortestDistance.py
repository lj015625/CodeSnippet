Letâ€™s say we have a group of N friends represented by a list of dictionaries
where each value is a friend name and their location on a three dimensional scale of (x, y, z).
The friends want to host a party but want the friend with the optimal location
(least distance to travel as a group) to host it.

Write a function pick_host to return the friend that should host the party.
