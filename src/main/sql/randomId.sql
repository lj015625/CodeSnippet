# Letâ€™s say we have a table with an id and name fields. The table holds over 100 million rows
# and we want to sample a random row in the table without throttling the database.
#
# Write a query to randomly sample a row from this table.
#
# Input:
#
# big_table table
#
# Columns	Type
# id	    INTEGER
# name	    VARCHAR

               ) AS id

ORDER BY r1.id ASC
